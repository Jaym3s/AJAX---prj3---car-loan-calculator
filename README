Project Overview

This project is intended to start working with AJAX and dealing with server-side interaction through client-side script
Project Requirements - AJAX, Server-Side Code, Cascading Drop-Down Lists

- use cascading drop-down-lists
x- once a manufacturer(make) is chosen
 x - retrieve the corresponding models from server-side code. 
  x  - once a model is chosen
   x   - retrieve the corresponding trim level for that particular model from server-side code.
    x    - based on the trim level the user selected
     x     - retrieve a calculated price (see vehicle info below)
- allow the user to put a down payment on the car
- allow the user to select an interest rate (0 - 10 whole numbers only)
- allow the user to select a loan term (24 months, 36 months, 48 months, or 60 months)
- calculate the monthly payment based on the above information
this should all be done inside of a CarService class within javascript except when noted to use server side code

:Project Inputs

The projects inputs for this project are user input - they select the make, model, and trim level. 
Based on the model and trim level, you will have a price. 
The user then enters the downpayment, the interest rate, and loan term.
